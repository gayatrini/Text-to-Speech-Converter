# Text-to-Speech-Converter
I developed a Text-to-Speech app using Streamlit and gTTS. Users can enter text, which is then converted to speech and played back in the app. The app features a custom background, stylish buttons, and a user-friendly interface. It's a simple yet powerful tool for converting text to audio. Check out the code !
